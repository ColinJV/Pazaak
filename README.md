## Description
This is a Pazaak game with SFML graphics that was made for a Computer Science 122 Data Structures in C/C++ class at Washington State University. Pazaak is a 1v1 card game originating in the Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic series, in which the objective is to draw cards totalling 20 points. Whichever player ends a round with the highest score wins the round, and the first player to win three rounds wins the match. For this example the other player is a rudimentary AI.
