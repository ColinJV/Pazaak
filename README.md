## Description
This is a Pazaak game with SFML graphics that was made for a Computer Science 122 Data Structures in C/C++ class at Washington State University. Pazaak is a 1v1 card game originating in the Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic series, in which the objective is to draw cards totalling 20 points. Whichever player ends a round with the highest score that is less than or equal to 20 wins the round, and the first player to win three rounds wins the match. For this example the other player is a rudimentary AI.
